I want to detect any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers under Section 164.514(a) of the HIPAA Privacy Rules for an individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual. Here are the identifiers:

‚Äú1. Names;
2. All geographical subdivisions smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if specific census conditions are met.
3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, and all ages over 89.
4. Phone numbers;
5. Fax numbers;
6. Electronic mail addresses;
7. Social Security numbers;
8. Medical record numbers;
9. Health plan beneficiary numbers;
10. Account numbers;
11. Certificate/license numbers;
12. Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers;
13. Device identifiers and serial numbers;
14. Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs);
15. Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers;
16. Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints;
17. Full face photographic images and any comparable images; and
18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code.‚Äù

Please detect HIPAA identifiers in a step-by-step fashion. First, internally identify all named entities. Then, determine and output which of those entities are part of the 18 HIPAA identifiers.

Now you detect HIPAA identifiers, please explain your thinking using this format:

Rationale:
<your thinking>

Final Answer:
<List of any HIPAA identifiers found or write "No HIPAA identifiers in the text">

Here is the text to consider:
